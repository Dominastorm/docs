# Server-side Go SDK
The Hop server-side Go SDK allows you to interact with all Hop products on the server side. 

## Usage

Reference the Hop Go SDK in your imports:

<Code>
```go {3}
import (
	...
	"github.com/hopinc/hop-go"
	...
)
```
</Code>

Once you run any Go command, the Go toolchain will fetch and install the SDK automatically.

## Creating an SDK Instance

To use the SDK, you must first create a [project token](/reference/project_tokens). You can also use a PAT (personal access token), however this is not recommended as it has access to all of your projects.

<Code>
```go {11}
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/hopinc/hop-go"
)

const HopToken = "ptk_xxx" 

func main() {
	c, err := hop.NewClient(HopToken)
	if err != nil {
		// Handle your error here!
		panic(err)
	}

	// Example: getting a channel by ID
	ch, err := c.Channels.Get(context.Background(), "test")
	if err != nil {
		// Handle your error here!
		panic(err)
	}
}
```
</Code>

## Specifying the Project ID

If you do not use a project token, you must also specify the project ID. You can do this in 1 of 2 ways:

1. You can set this at a client level:
	<Code>
	```go {2}
	...
	c.AddClientOptions(hop.WithProjectID("project_id"))
	...
	```
	</Code>

2. You can set this at a request level:
	<Code>
	```go {2}
	...
	ch, err := c.Channels.Get(context.Background(), "test", hop.WithProjectID("project_id"))
	...
	```
	</Code>

hop-go will prefer options which are set at a functional level.
