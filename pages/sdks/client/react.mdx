# React SDK

The Hop React library allows you to easily integrate Hop products, such as Channels and Pipe, into your frontend.

## Installation

To use the React SDK, you have to install both our vanilla JS SDK & our React SDK into your application.

Client JS SDK: `@onehop/client`  
React SDK: `@onehop/react`

### npm
```bash
npm i @onehop/client @onehop/react
```

### Yarn
```bash
yarn add @onehop/client @onehop/react
```

## Initializing the SDK

To use the React SDK within your app, you first must call the `init` method from @onehop/client with your project ID. This should be done as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

Find your project ID on [this page](https://console.hop.io/project/settings).

<Code>
```jsx
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { hop } from "@onehop/client";
import App from "./App";

// hop.init should be called as early as possible in your application's lifecycle
hop.init({
	projectId: "project_xxx": // replace with your project ID
});

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
```
</Code>

### With Next.js

If using Next.js (or SSR in general), then you need to make sure that the client gets initialized on the **client-side**, not the server. To do this, we recommend initializing the Hop Client in a `useEffect` in your `_app` file, for example:

<Code>
```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { hop } from "@onehop/client";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	useEffect(() => {
		if (typeof window === "undefined") {
			return;
		}

		hop.init({
			projectId: "project_xxx": // replace with your project ID
		});
	}, []);

	return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```
</Code>
