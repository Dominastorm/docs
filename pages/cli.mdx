# CLI

The Hop CLI allows you to manage and control every aspect of your Hop projects. It acts as a command-line replacement for the Hop Console with some extra features to support Hop deployments.

## Install

### Shell Script (Unix-like, Linux, macOS)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://hop.io/install-cli | sh
```

## Login

Once installed, you will be able to use the following command to authenticate the CLI with your Hop account. This will open a browser window to login.

```sh
hop auth login
```

<Callout>
If you want to login to the Hop CLI in a headless environment (e.g. without a browser), then you can provide a [Project Token](/reference/project_tokens) or a PAT using the `--token` flag.
