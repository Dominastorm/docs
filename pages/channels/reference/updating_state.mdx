# Updating Channel State

[Channel State](/channels/state) acts as a realtime data store attached to every Channel. You can update this state on your backend and frontend clients can subscribe to Channel state objects in realtime.

<Callout type="info">This reference assumes you have already set up the [Hop server-side SDK](/sdks/server/js).</Callout>

## Updating State

Channel state can be updated (manually) through the Hop Console or (programatically) through our server-side SDKs.

<Code>
```js {11,19} title="updating-state.js"
// Import your Hop SDK instance
import { hop } from ".";

const channelId = "channel_xxx"; // the channel we want to update

/**
 * Option 1: Rewrite the state.
 * The existing state is passed as the first arument to Channel#setState
 */

hop.channels.setState(channelId, s => ({ ...s, name: "My Channel" }));

/**
 * Option 2: Update or add variables
 * This operation will only effect the variables you specify.
 * The rest of the state will remain unchanged
 */

channel.patchState(channelId, { name: "My Channel" });
```
</Code>

Either of these operations will update the connected clients in realtime.
