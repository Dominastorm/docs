  "Along with Channel State, the other primary function of Channels is the
  ability to send messages to Channel subscribers in realtime."
---

Messages can be sent to channels from your backend (e.g. an API, a serverless
function, etc) and be received by Channel subscribers (on your frontend app, for
example).

## Message Structure

When sending a message to a channel, you must specify 2 fields:

- an **event name**, and
- message data

The event name can be an arbritrary string of your choosing - for example, if we
were making a group chat application and wanted to send a channel message when
someone sends a chat message, we might call that event `MESSAGE_CREATE`.

The data field can be any object. In the case of our group chat example, we
might include the message content and author in the data object.

<Info>
  This reference assumes you have already set up the [Hop server-side
  SDK](/sdks/server/js).

## Publish a Message to a Channel

```js sending-messages.js
// Import your Hop SDK instance
import { hop } from ".";

const channelId = "channel_xxx"; // the channel we want to send a message to

await hop.channels.publishMessage(
  channelId,
  // event name of your choosing
  "MESSAGE_CREATE",
  // event data, this can be any object you want it to be
  {
    content: "Hello Hop Channels!",
    author_name: "Vanilla",
  }
);
```
