# CLI

The Hop CLI allows you to manage and control every aspect of your Hop projects. It acts as a command-line replacement for the Hop Console with some extra features to support Hop deployments.

## Install

### Shell Script (Linux, macOS and FreeBSD)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://hop.io/install-cli | sh
```

### Arch Linux
Use your favourite AUR helper to install the package:

```bash
# yay example
$ yay -S hop-cli
```

### Windows
Install with the [Hop Windows Installer 64bit](https://download.hop.sh/windows/x86_64) or the [Hop Windows Installer 32bit](https://download.hop.sh/windows/i686)

## Login

Once installed, you will be able to use the following command to authenticate the CLI with your Hop account. This will open a browser window to login.

```sh
hop auth login
```

<Callout>
If you want to login to the Hop CLI in a headless environment (e.g. without a browser), then you can provide a [Project Token](/reference/project_tokens) or a PAT using the `--token` flag.
</Callout>

## Projects

When first logging in, the CLI will execute commands against your default personal project.

### Switching Projects

You can switch projects using the following command:

```sh
hop projects switch
```

This will bring up an interface that allows you to use arrow keys to select a project:
<br/>
<Image src={cliSwitchProject}/>

You can also use `hop projects switch <namespace>` to perform the switch directly.

### Project override flag

You can specify `--project` on any Hop CLI command to override the currently selected project for the current command.

## More

Use `hop help` to view a full list of command categories. You can also use `hop <category> help` for a list of commands within a category.
