# Server Side Go API Client

The Hop server side Go API client allows you to interact with all Hop products on the server side.

## Usage

Reference the Hop Go API client in your imports:

<Code>
```go {2}
import (
	hop "go.hop.io/sdk"
)
```
</Code>

Once you run any Go command, the Go toolchain will fetch and install the SDK automatically.

## Creating a Client Instance

To use the SDK, you must first create a [project token](/reference/project_tokens). You can also use a PAT (personal access token), however this is not recommended as it has access to all of your projects.

<Code>
```go {11}
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

    hop "go.hop.io/sdk"
)

const HopToken = "ptk_xxx"

func main() {
	c, err := hop.NewClient(HopToken)
	if err != nil {
		// Handle your error here!
		panic(err)
	}

    // Example: getting a channel by ID
    ch, err := c.Channels.Get(context.Background(), "test")
    if err != nil {
    	// Handle your error here!
    	panic(err)
    }
}
```
</Code>

## Specifying the Project ID

If you do not use a project token, you must also specify the project ID. You can do this in 1 of 2 ways:

1. You can set this at a client level:
	<Code>
	```go
	c.AddClientOptions(hop.WithProjectID("project_id"))
	```
	</Code>

2. You can set this at a request level:
	<Code>
	```go
	ch, err := c.Channels.Get(context.Background(), "test", hop.WithProjectID("project_id"))
	```
	</Code>

hop-go will prefer options which are set at a functional level.
