## Overview

Hop allows developers to quickly and easily deploy their code and start serving traffic to the masses without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

As a deployment platform, we've created developer-friendly abstractions that offer extensive visibility and control, freeing developers from the complexities of solutions such as Kubernetes. We allow you to deploy straight from GitHub or DockerHub with no configuration needed, as well as providing presets for popular services such as Redis, Postgres and more.
