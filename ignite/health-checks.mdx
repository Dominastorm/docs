Health Checks can be set up per Ignite deployment to make sure that:

- Traffic is only directed to containers that pass the check, and
- New builds smoothly roll out without downtime

This is done by querying the containers periodically to make sure they're alive
and healthy. You can choose how to respond to a health check. For example, you
may only want to respond successfully to a health check once your program has
connected to its database.

## Options

### Protocol-Specific Options

| Option | Example         | Description                                                              |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Path   | `/health_check` | the HTTP path that should be queried to check if your service is healthy |
| Port   | `8080`          | the port that your service is running on                                 |

### Advanced Options

| Option        | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial Delay | 5          | How long Ignite should wait before sending the first health check                                                                                                    |
| Interval      | 60         | How long Ignite should wait (in seconds) between sending health checks                                                                                               |
| Timeout       | 10000      | The maximum time, in milliseconds, that should be tolerated for receiving a response to the health check. If exceeded, the container will be determined as unhealthy |
| Maximum       | Failures 3 | How many times the health check needs to fail for a container to be determined unhealthy                                                                             |

## Creating Health Checks

Currently, Ignite only supports HTTP(s)-based health checks. When setting up a
health check, you can choose the HTTP path to be queried to make sure the
container is alive.

To respond successfully to a health check, you must respond on the path
specified when creating the health check with a `HTTP 2xx` response code, such
as `200` or `204`.

### Creating via Console

1. Navigate to an Ignite deployment
2. Select **Health Check** from the sidebar
3. Click **Create Check** in the top right
