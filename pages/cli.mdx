# CLI

The Hop CLI allows you to manage and control every aspect of your Hop projects. It acts as a command-line replacement for the Hop Console with some extra features to support Hop deployments.

## Install

### Shell Script (Unix-like, Linux, macOS)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://hop.io/install-cli | sh
```

## Login

Once installed, you will be able to use the following command to authenticate the CLI with your Hop account. This will open a browser window to login.

```sh
hop auth login
```

<Callout>
If you want to login to the Hop CLI in a headless environment (e.g. without a browser), then you can provide a [Project Token](/reference/project_tokens) or a PAT using the `--token` flag.
</Callout>

## Projects

When first logging in, the CLI will execute commands against your default personal project.

### Switching Projects

You can switch projects using the following command:

```sh
hop projects switch
```

This will bring up an interface that allows you to use arrow keys to select a project:
<br/>
<Image src={cliSwitchProject}/>

You can also use `hop projects switch <namespace>` to perform the switch directly.

### Project override flag

You can specify `--project` on any Hop CLI command to override the currently selected project for the current command.
