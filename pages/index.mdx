## Product Summary

### Ignite

> Deploy any kind of application. Leave the infrastructure to us.

Ignite provides containers as a service. Think about it like Kubernetes, without the hassle and boilerplate that comes with it. Ignite also offers the option to attach GPUs to your containers.

### Pipe

> Stream anything to Pipe. We'll distribute the stream to your customers in low-latency, worldwide.

Need to stream live video to clients? Think Pipe. From 1 to 1 million live viewers, Pipe will handle the scale for you, no intervention needed.

Realtime, stateful objects that live on the edge. Use them to store realtime data or to send message events to Channel subscribers with a simple call to our SDK. Very configurable and feature-rich; use them to create anything from a realtime stock ticker to a full-featured chat platform.
