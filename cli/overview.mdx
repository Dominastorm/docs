```

[Hop Windows Installer 64bit](https://download.hop.sh/windows/x86_64) or the
[Hop Windows Installer 32bit](https://download.hop.sh/windows/i686)

## Login

Once installed, you will be able to use the following command to authenticate
the CLI with your Hop account. This will open a browser window to login.

```

## Projects

When first logging in, the CLI will execute commands against your default
personal project.

#### Switching Projects

You can switch projects using the following command:

```
hop projects switch
```

This will bring up an interface that allows you to use arrow keys to select a
project:

![](/images/cli-switch.png)

You can also use `hop projects switch <namespace>` to perform the switch
directly.

#### Project override flag

You can specify `--project` on any Hop CLI command to override the currently
selected project for the current command.

### More

Use `hop help` to view a full list of command categories. You can also use
`hop <category> help` for a list of commands within a category.
