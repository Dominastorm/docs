Hop makes it easy to deploy any Node.js application. This guide focusses on the deployment of an Express application, however it applies to any Node.js web application.

## Demo

We have created a demo application that you can deploy to Hop to see how it works. It's a simple Express application that exposes a single endpoint that returns the hostname of the container it's running on.

### Deploying the demo

1. Fork [node-express-app](https://github.com/hop-examples/node-express-app) on GitHub.
2. Create a new Hop deployment on the Console and select the GitHub repository you just forked.
3. Hit `Deploy` and wait for the build to finish.
4. To expose your application to the web, create a [Gateway](/ignite/gateways) and point it to port `3000`.

That's it! You're now able to scale your Express application horizontally and take advantage of all the features Hop has to offer.
