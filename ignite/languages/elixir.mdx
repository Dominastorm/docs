Elixir applications are detected when you have a `mix.exs` file in your project root. Dependencies are installed with `mix deps.get` and the application is built with `mix compile`.

## Clustering

Thanks to a community member, you can use [libcluster](https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster) directly with Hop to automatically cluster your Elixir applications. You can find the `libcluster_hop` strategy [here](https://github.com/hiett/libcluster_hop).

## Versions

By default, the Elixir version for your project is inferred from the `elixir` version in your `mix.exs` file.

The following Elixir versions are available:

- latest (**default**)
- 1.12
- 1.11
- 1.10
- 1.9

If you need to support a version that isn't listed above, you should write a custom `Dockerfile`.

### Overriding the version

The version can be overridden by:

- Setting the `ELIXIR_VERSION` environment variable
