title: "Deploying to Hop"
description:
  "Any application of any size, language or framework can be deployed to Hop.
  Deployments are Ignite's primary abstraction - containers run inside them."
---

However you create a new deployment on Hop, we'll internally create a
"deployment config" which contains values such as the image, default resource
allocations and environment variables for the deployment. When containers start,
they read off of this deployment config. You can also provide custom overrides
per container if needed, though this is rarely needed.

## Deployment Methods

There are various ways to create and deploy new versions to existing
deployments.

### GitHub

Deploying to Hop from GitHub allows you to easily connect a GitHub repository to
Ignite and have your project be automatically deployed when you push to your
main branch.

To deploy from GitHub, we will use the
[Hop Console](https://console.hop.io/auth)

#### Creating the Deployment

Select "Create Deployment" under the **Ignite** page.

If you're not sure what container type to pick, we recommend using
**Persistent**.

#### Linking GitHub Account

You will now be prompted to link your GitHub account to Hop. Once connected, you
can give Hop permission to all or individual repositories on your account.

Once permission is granted, you can select the repository to use and create the
deployment. Once created, the first build for your application will start. You
can view the build logs in realtime through the console - when it's built, it'll
create a container to start serving your deployment.

#### Pushing Updates to your Deployment

To push an update to a GitHub deployment, simply `git push` to the main branch.

Hop will automatically detect this push and will begin building the new release.
Once built, Hop will create a rollout: create containers for the new build and
delete the old ones once the new ones are running.

### Hop CLI

The easiest way to deploy a project directory is to use the
[Hop CLI](/cli/overview).

#### Installation

Follow the [install guide](/cli/overview/#install) to install the CLI on your
machine.

#### Deploying

Once installed and logged into the CLI, you can navigate to your project
directory in your terminal and use `hop deploy`.

```
hop deploy
```

If this is the first time deploying this project to Hop, the CLI will walk you
through creating a new deployment before finally building and deploying your
project. You can also
[link existing deployments to directories](/ignite/deploying#linking-a-project-directory-to-an-existing-deployment).

#### Pushing Updates

If you need to deploy an update, just run `hop deploy` again and it'll take care
of the rest, including smoothly rolling out new containers to guarantee uptime.

#### Rolling Back

If you accidentally pushed out a bad update, you can use the following command
to roll back to the previous deployment.

Linking a Project Directory to an Existing Deployment If you've already created
a deployment on Hop and want to link a project directory to that deployment, you
can use:

```
hop link [deployment_id]
```

If a deployment ID isn't specified, then you will be given a list of your
deployments to select from.
