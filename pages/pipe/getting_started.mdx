# Getting Started

Pipe allows you to deliver real-time livestreams to users across the globe withour worrying about scale. As a developer, Pipe is easy to integrate - there's only 3 steps to getting your first broadcast going.

- [Easy mode (use Console UI & OBS)](#easy-mode)
- [Advanced mode (use our SDK/API & ffmpeg)](#advanced-mode)




## Easy Mode

We'll create a room, stream to it through OBS, then view the stream through the Pipe testing tool.

### Creating the Room

Head over to the [Rooms tab](https://console.hop.io/pipe/rooms) under the Pipe page in the Console.

Click "Create Room" in the top right. You'll be presented with a modal:

<br/>
<Image height={400} objectFit={'contain'} src={crModal}/>

For this example, stick to **RTMP** for the ingest protocol and **LLHLS** for delivery. You can optionally give the stream a name.

Click **Create Room**.

<Image height={400} objectFit={'contain'} src={rcModal}/>

Use the <span><img style={{display: "inline", height: "1em", margin: "0px 3px"}} src="/icons/clipboard.png"/></span> button to copy the **Ingest Endpoint** to your clipboard.

### Streaming via OBS
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) allows you to quickly and easily set up a livestream from your machine. Once downloaded, head over to the "Stream" tab in the Settings page:
<br/>
<Image height={400} objectFit={'contain'} src={obs1}/>

For **Service**, Select **Custom**.

Paste the Ingest Endpoint you copied above into the **Server** input. It'll look something like this:
```
rtmp://cinnamon-iad1-prd.origin.hopvideo.net/v.vanilla/psk_c184ZTM2Y2Q3YzMxNDU3NjZjMmNkYmE5YzQzNTI2MThhOV8zMjUyOTM4ODQzNjc0MjE1Nw
```

Copy the last segment (after the `/`) from the endpoint. This is technically what OBS calls the "Stream Key". Paste it into **Stream Key** input, then delete it from the **Server** input, along with the final `/`.

Once done, your Stream config should look something like this:
<br/>
<Image objectFit={'contain'} src={obs2}/>

Click **OK**.

You can now hit the **Start Streaming** button. You're now streaming to Pipe!

Before we get started, make sure you obtain a Project Token with "Manage Pipe" permissions from the Console and use it to initialize the Hop SDK.
