# Server-side Go SDK
The Hop server-side Go SDK allows you to interact with all Hop products on the server side. 

## Usage

Reference the Hop Go SDK in your imports:

<Code>
```go {3}
import (
	...
	"github.com/hopinc/hop-go"
	...
)
```
</Code>

Once you run any Go command, the Go toolchain will fetch and install the SDK automatically.

## Creating an SDK Instance

To use the SDK, you must first create a [project token](/reference/project_tokens). You can also use a PAT (personal access token), however this is not recommended as it has access to all of your projects.

<Code>
```go {11}
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/hopinc/hop-go"
)

const HopToken = "ptk_xxx" 

func main() {
	c, _ := hop.NewClient(HopToken)

	// Example: getting a channel by ID
	ch, _ := c.Channels.Get(context.Background(), "test")
}
```
</Code>
