title: "Server Side Go API Client"
description:
  "The Hop server side Go API client allows you to interact with all Hop
  products on the server side."
---

## Usage

Reference the Hop Go API client in your imports:

```go GO
import (
	hop "go.hop.io/sdk"
)
```

Once you run any Go command, the Go toolchain will fetch and install the SDK
automatically.

## Creating a Client Instance

To use the SDK, you must first create a
[project token](/reference/project-tokens). You can also use a PAT (personal
access token), however this is not recommended as it has access to all of your
projects.

```go GO
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

 hop "go.hop.io/sdk"
)

const HopToken = "ptk_xxx"

func main() {
	c, err := hop.NewClient(HopToken)
	if err != nil {
		// Handle your error here!
		panic(err)
	}

 // Example: getting a channel by ID
 ch, err := c.Channels.Get(context.Background(), "test")
 if err != nil {
 	// Handle your error here!
 	panic(err)
 }
}
```

## Specifying the Project ID

If you do not use a project token, you must also specify the project ID. You can
do this in 1 of 2 ways:

1. You can set this at a client level:

```go GO
c.AddClientOptions(hop.WithProjectID("project_id"))
```

2. You can set this at a request level:

```go GO
ch, err := c.Channels.Get(context.Background(), "test", hop.WithProjectID("project_id"))
```

hop-go will prefer options which are set at a functional level.
