title: 'Persistent Volumes'
description: "Volumes allow you to persist data across containers - perserving your deployment's state after restarts"
---

<Warning>
	Currently, deployments with persistent volumes can only run one container at
	once
</Warning>

You can attach a volume to a deployment under a specified mount path, such as `/data`. This will persist within your deployment, even when containers are deleted.

You can choose between `ext4` and `xfs` for your filesystem format.
