Golang is detected when you have a `main.go` file in your project root. If a `go.mod` file is found, packages are installed with `go get`. Hop uses `go build` to compile your application, then executes the resulting binary.

## Versions

The version is parsed from the `go.mod` file.

The following Go versions are available:

- 1.18
- 1.17 (**default**)
