# Creating Channels

You can create channels manually (through the Hop Console/CLI) or through our SDKs and API.

<Callout>Channels cannot be created by frontend clients. You must use our server-side SDKs or API to create them. This reference assumes you have already set up the [Hop server-side SDK](/sdks/server/js).</Callout>


## Creating a Channel

<Code>
```js
// Import your Hop SDK instance
import { hop } from ".";

// Create a channel with the ID "group_chat_1"
const channel = await hop.channels.create(
	// Channel Type; either: "unprotected", "public", or "private"
	"unprotected",
	// Channel ID; leave this field as null if you want an auto-generated ID
	"group_chat_1"
);
```
</Code>

### Creating a Channel with some Initial State
<Code>
```js
// Import your Hop SDK instance
import { hop } from ".";

// Create a channel with the ID "group_chat_2" and some initial state
const channel = await hop.channels.create(
	"unprotected",
	"group_chat_2",
	// Creation Options
	{
		// Initial Channel state object
		state: {
			name: "Group Chat",
			my_custom_value: 123
		}
	}
)
```
</Code>

## Channel Types

**Private** channels allow you to individually grant tokens access to channels, either by calling a method from the server-side SDK or by responding to a webhook call when tokens try to subscribe, which you can set up on the Channels console page

**Public** channels allow any leap token to join them, given they're authenticated under your project and know the channel ID.

**Unprotected** channels allow anyone to join them, even if they're not authenticated with a token, given they know the channel ID
