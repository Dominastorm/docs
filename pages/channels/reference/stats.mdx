# Channel Stats

We provide functionality to get statistics about certain channels, such as how many users are currently connected to them.

<Callout type="info">This reference assumes you have already set up the [Hop server-side SDK](/sdks/server/js).</Callout>

## Get Stats

The following function will return the following type:
```js
{
	// how many clients are connected to this channel
	online_count: <number>
}
```

<Code>
```js
// Import your Hop SDK instance
import { hop } from ".";

const channelId = "channel_xxx"; // the channel we want to get statistics for

const stats = await hop.channels.getStats(channelId);
/*
 *	stats = {
 *		"online_count": 0	
 *	}
 */
```
</Code>
