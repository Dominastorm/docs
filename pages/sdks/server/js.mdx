# Server-side JS SDK
The Hop server-side JS SDK allows you to interact with all Hop products on the server side. Currently, the SDK is compatible with [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Installing

```bash
# NPM
npm i @onehop/js

# Or with Yarn
yarn add @onehop/js

# Or with Bun
bun add @onehop/js
```


## Creating an SDK Instance

To use the SDK, you must first create a [project token](/reference/project_tokens). You can also use a PAT (personal access token), however this is not recommended as it has access to all of your projects.

<Code>
```js
import { Hop } from '@onehop/js';

const myToken = 'ptk_xxx';
// Export the Hop SDK instance so you can use it throughout your codebase
export const hop = new Hop(myToken);

// Example: Creating a project secret
hop.projects.secrets.create(
	'RANDOM_NUMBER',
	Math.floor(Math.random() * 100).toString(),
);
```
</Code>
