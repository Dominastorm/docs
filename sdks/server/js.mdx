  "The Hop server-side JS SDK allows you to interact with all Hop products on
  the server side."
---

Currently, the SDK is compatible with [Bun](https://bun.sh/),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Deno](https://deno.land/).

## Installing

```bash
# NPM
npm i @onehop/js

# Or with Yarn
yarn add @onehop/js

# Or with Bun
bun add @onehop/js
```

Or in Deno, we recommend serving from jspm.dev. This will ensure dependencies
are bundled and cached for you.

```bash
import {Hop} from 'https://jspm.dev/@onehop/js@<version>';
```

## Creating an SDK Instance

To use the SDK, you must first create a
[project token](/reference/project-tokens). You can also use a PAT (personal
access token), however this is not recommended as it has access to all of your
projects.

```js JS
import { Hop } from '@onehop/js';

const myToken = 'ptk_xxx';

// Export the Hop SDK instance so you can use it throughout your codebase
export const hop = new Hop(myToken);

// Example: Creating a project secret
await hop.projects.secrets.create(
 'RANDOM_NUMBER',
 Math.floor(Math.random() \* 100).toString(),
);
```
