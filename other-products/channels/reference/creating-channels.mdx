  "You can create channels manually (through the Hop Console/CLI) or through our
  SDKs and API."

<Note>
  Channels cannot be created by frontend clients. You must use our server-side
  SDKs or API to create them. This reference assumes you have already set up the
  [Hop server-side SDK](/sdks/server/js).
</Note>

## Creating a Channel

```js create-channel.js
// Import your Hop SDK instance
import { hop } from ".";

// Import the ChannelType enum from Hop sdk
import { ChannelType } from "@onehop/js";

// Create a channel with the ID "group_chat_1"
const channel = await hop.channels.create(
  // Channel Type; either: "unprotected", "public", or "private"
  ChannelType.UNPROTECTED,
  // Channel ID; leave this field as null if you want an auto-generated ID
  "group_chat_1"
);
```

### Creating a Channel with some Initial State

```js create-channel-with-state.js
import { hop } from ".";
import { ChannelType } from "@onehop/js";

// Create a channel with the ID "group_chat_2" and some initial state
const channel = await hop.channels.create(
  ChannelType.UNPROTECTED,
  "group_chat_2",
  // Creation Options
  {
    // Initial Channel state object
    state: {
      name: "Group Chat",
      my_custom_value: 123,
    },
  }
);
```

## Channel Types

**Private** channels allow you to individually grant tokens access to channels,
either by calling a method from the server-side SDK or by responding to a
webhook call when tokens try to subscribe, which you can set up on the Channels
console page

**Public** channels allow any leap token to join them, given they're
authenticated under your project and know the channel ID.

**Unprotected** channels allow anyone to join them, even if they're not
authenticated with a token, given they know the channel ID
