# JS Client SDK

The Hop JS Client SDK allows you to interact with Hop products from your frontend application.

## Installation

The JS Client SDK is hosted on NPM under `@onehop/client`.

### npm

```bash
npm i @onehop/client
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @onehop/client
```

## Initializing the SDK

Find your project ID on [this page](https://console.hop.io/project/settings).

<Code>

```jsx showLineNumbers
import { hop } from "@onehop/client";

// hop.init should be called as early as possible in your application's lifecycle

hop.init({
    projectId: "project_xxx": // replace with your project ID
});
```

</Code>
