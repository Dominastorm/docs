# Builds

<Callout type="info">
	If you're looking on how to push your own pre-built images to Hop, see
	[Images](./images). This page covers Hop's built-in build system.
</Callout>

Image builds are automatically triggered when using `hop deploy` or when pushing to the main branch of a git-synced Ignite deployment.

You can view current & previous builds & their logs in the **Build Logs** tab in an Ignite deployment. If triggered by a `git push`, it'll contain information about the commit & author.

## Rollouts

Once builds are complete, Ignite will automatically _roll out_ your deployment. Rollouts duplicate your current running containers & their configurations, but apply the new build image to them instead, then delete the old containers once traffic has migrated over to the new ones.

**Rollouts are smart:** they make sure that the new containers are running without error before cutting traffic over.

Rollouts can also be triggered by updating the environment variables on an Ignite deployment.

### The Rollout Flow

Once a rollout is triggered, the following happens:

1. **One new container is started** using the newly built image.
2. Ignite waits for the container to start into the `RUNNING` state without error. If an error occurs during startup, the rollout is considered failed and old containers won't be deleted.
3. If a [Health Check](./health_check) is configured on the deployment, Ignite will wait for it to succeed before continuing. If it fails after the **Max Attempts**, the rollout fails.
4. If the above checks pass without issue, Ignite will start the remaining containers (to mirror the same amount of containers that are running the old build).
5. Once traffic migrates off of the old containers, they will be deleted. The rollout has succeeded.
